# Bitburner-Plugin TODOs

## Synchronize

- Pushed all the scripts in my WebStorm/IntelliJ project to Bitburner game.
- Retrieved all the scripts from Bitburner game to my project in WebStorm/IntelliJ.

## IDE: action menu

- Create one group for Bitburner. When the user expands the secondary menu from the file in the project or in the
  editor.
    - Clicking in the file _hello.js_ to show the secondary menu, it will show in the first row the menu
      _Bitburner >_. When the mouse is over this option it will expand and show three options: _Push this file_,
      _Push all files_, _Pull all files_.
- Add a confirmation alert when the options are _Push all files_ or _Pull all files_.
